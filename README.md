# iii) Known Limitations or Suggestions for Improvement
This section should highlight any potential areas for improvement or limitations of your assistant.

**Example**:
## Known Limitations:
- The current version does not support complex queries involving multiple tables or joins beyond the `Employees` and `Departments` tables.
- The error handling for incorrect queries can be improved.
- The database is static, so it cannot be modified through the app itself.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
- Support for more complex queries with additional tables and filtering options.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for accessing sensitive data.
- Implement a feature to update or modify database records via the assistant.
